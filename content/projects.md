# Some Projects I've Worked On

## Personal
- [Boid-like Simulation](https://github.com/fivegrant/swarm): Implemented a 3D [Boid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) simulation as static site.
  Users can customize the behavior of each agent. [Live demo can be found here.](https://fivegrant.github.io/swarm/)
- [Game of Life](https://github.com/fivegrant/gol): Implemented Conway's Game of Life in
  the browser. Use the mouse to toggle a cell. Press `s` to pause and `w` to
  resume. The direction in time can be changed using `a` and `d`.
  [Live demo can be found here.](https://fivegrant.github.io/gol/)
- [Ray Tracer](https://github.com/fivegrant/advanced-computer-graphics): Built a Ray Tracer
  in C++ for a graphics class. The implementation came from 
  [Jamis Buck's book](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/).

## Group
- [BallotProject](https://ballotproject.org/): Researched voter information
  with the BallotProject, verifying the validity of registration
  data and predicting political affiliations.
- [TCP File Transer](https://github.com/fivegrant/tcp_file_transfer): Wrote a small command line
  utility with my friend that allows you to transfer files using the IP
  address of the receiver. 
- [POS System](https://github.com/bennington-hardware-hacking-2019/pos_system): Collaborated
  a group to make a POS system. For this project, I primarily focused
  on the hardware reading cards over NFC.
- [Quarantine File System](https://github.com/bennington-distributed-systems-s2020/Quarantine-File-System): Participated
  in a class-wide project focused on implementing Google File System.

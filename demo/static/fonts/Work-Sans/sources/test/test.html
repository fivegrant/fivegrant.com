<p class="fourteen">The <b>Rock hyrax</b> <em>(Grocavia capensis),</em> also called <b>rock badger</b>, <b>rock rabbit</b>, and <b>Cape hyrax</b>, is commonly referred to in South African English as the <b>dassie</b>. It is one of the four living species of the order Hyracoidea, and the only living species in the genus Procavia. Like all hyraxes, it is a medium-sized terrestrial mammal between 4 kilograms (9 lb) and 5 kilograms (11 lb) in mass, with short ears and tail.
<br><br>
<em>The rock hyrax is found across Africa and the Middle East, at elevations up to 4,200 metres (13,800 ft).</em> It resides in habitats with rock crevices which it uses to escape from predators. It is the only extant terrestrial afrotherian in the Middle East. Hyraxes <em>typically</em> live in groups of 10–80 animals, and forage as a group. They have been reported to use sentries: one or more animals take up position on a vantage point and issue alarm calls on the approach of predators. The rock hyrax has incomplete <b>thermoregulation</b> and is most active in the morning and evening, although its activity pattern varies substantially with season and climate.
<br><br>
<b>Over most of its range, the rock hyrax is not endangered,</b> and in some areas is considered a minor pest. In Ethiopia, Israel and Jordan, it is a reservoir of the leishmaniasis parasite. Along with other hyrax species and the manatee, this species is the most closely related to th The rock hyrax is squat and <em>heavily built</em>, adults reaching a length of 50 cm (20 in) and weighing around 4 kg (8.8 lb), with a slight sexual dimorphism, males being approximately 10% heavier than females. Their fur is thick and <em>grey-brown, although this varies strongly</em> between different environments: from dark brown in wetter habitats, to light gray in desert living individuals. Hyrax size (as measured by skull length and humerus diameter) is correlated to precipitation, probably because of the effect on preferred hyrax forage.e elephant.

      this site is made with plain html and
      <a href = "https://sass-lang.com/">sass</a>, but i 
      may use javascript in the future if i feel compelled
      to add more complex functionality. i 
      manage my dependencies
      (http server, sass compiler) with
      <a href ="https://nixos.org/">nix</a>, a tool i highly
      recommend.

      i'm currently hosting 
      <a href = "https://fivegrant.com">fivegrant.com</a>
      using
      <a href = "https://www.digitalocean.com">digital ocean</a>.
      i hope to one day host it on my own bare metal, but alas,
      i'm just a student without a place that is my own to leave
      a server running a corner.

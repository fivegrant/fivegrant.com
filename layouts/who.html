    <p>
      hey! i'm five grant, an american undergraduate
      student who has done some software development
      along with a few other unrelated jobs during my 
      short tenure as an adult.
    </p>
    <p>
      some of the questions i'm interested in concern cognition,
      the application of 
      <a href = "https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/open-source-software">
      open-source</a>, 
      and the epistemology of
      the social sciences. i might not know much, however, i hope to 
      enrich my perspective on some of these things as i continue
      writing and hacking away at problems.
